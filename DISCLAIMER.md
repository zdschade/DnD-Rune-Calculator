The original concept for this spell writing system was created by The Gorilla of Destiny (@GorillaOfDestiny on tiktok, or @GorillaOfDest on twitter/X). The 11-pointed circle as the base, as well as the concept of connecting those points by encoding spell attributes into a binary number, came directly from their system. You can find their spell writing guide [here](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/429711/the-spell-writing-guide). If you want to understand the basic concept better, I highly recommend you give it a read.

# Complaints with the original system
While The Gorilla of Destiny's (GoD's) system is complex, modular, and in-depth; mine was adjusted to simplify it. Their system is fantastic if all you want to do is have some cool flavoring by showing these to your players or writing them in your own "spellbook" for realism. However, it is nearly impossible to memorize. A lot of the spell attributes have... quetionable choices in regards to their encoding, and they are not laid out in a comprehensible way in GoD's guide. Take the spell attribute for "Range". The list of ranges (from binary 1 upwards) jumps between different distances and types of range to the point that it seems random. This is not practial for use in-session.

# A shift in use case
I had a need for a glyph-writing system to use in-game, during combat. GoD's system was a fantastic starting point, but being near-impossible to memorize, it would not make the cut. So, I made some changes that drastically shorten the list of attributes to memorize while still making it a minor challenge for a player to draw one at the table. In this way, a player can simply memorize a short list of attributes and make the conversion to a binary number on the fly, drawing the glyph on a template at the table.

What would a player gain from doing such a thing, you might ask? Well, that is up to their DM! This was meant to be a drop-in solution that the player and their DM can discuss as needed. The original intention was to give large bonuses to the player for going through the work of memorizing what is essentially a very basic runic language. Put in the work up front, IRL, and reap the benefits in-game. Of course, this should come with drawbacks for balancing. In our particular case, if a spell was drawn wrong it simply fizzled out and you action was wasted OR the spell that was actually drawn is cast instead. Again this should be discussed beforehand, during character creation. Note that the player should **not** have access to the calculator during the game. That defeats the purpose of memorization.

That leads me to this "calculator". While I could see the draw for this up-front investment as described above, I did not believe that your DM should have to go though the same struggle to accomodate this alternative casting style. So, instead of making a dictionary, I made a simple calculator to check the spell. The process of using this system in game was intended to go like this:
1. The player is waiting to take their turn and picks which spell they want to cast when it is their turn again, as per usual.
2. The player figures out what attributes are needed to cast the spell, and makes note of them.
3. The player draws the glyph for that spell on their template, and holds onto it.
4. During their turn, the player tells the DM what they are casting, hands them the glyph for checking, and informs them of the attributes if necessary.
5. The DM enters the attributes into the calculator, checks it against the glyph, and makes a decision on the validity of the glyph.

In this way, the player does 95% of the work, and the DM simply clicks a few buttons and compares shapes.

# Adjustments and changes
My adjusted system intends to make it easier to use practially. Below are some common-sense changes that were made.
* Area attributes are not repeated in the range section, making the range list much shorter and easier to memorize.
* A few of the Area options were removed, namely the multiple choice options. These come up rarely, and if there is the option to use two different areas, the glyph should be drawn according to what is cast.
* Schools increase linearly from 1. GoD's system skips 2, which should be conjuration, instead making conjuration encode to 3. This, again, aids in memorization.
  * This change was made across the board where needed.
* All other formats for the glyph circle have been removed to ease the burden of checking the glyph's validity. They are not disallowed, but they are discouraged. See GoD's original system for other glyph styles.

# Final thoughts
Again, credit for the base concepts of this system goes to The Gorilla of Destiny. Even if you intend to only use this simplifed alternative system, I highly suggest giving their guide a read.
