# DnD-Rune-Calculator
A simple calculator to generate glyphs of spells using the spell's attributes. Parts of the spell are encoded into simple binary numbers, and are drawn on the glyph accordingly. For information on how the binary numbers are drawn on the glyph and what a K-Value is, please see Gorilla of Destiny's original system.

# Copyright and Disclaimer
The original concept for this spell writing system was created by The Gorilla of Destiny (@GorillaOfDestiny on tiktok, or @GorillaOfDest on twitter/X). The 11-pointed circle as the base, as well as the concept of connecting those points by encoding spell attributes into a binary number, came directly from their system. You can find their spell writing guide [here](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/429711/the-spell-writing-guide). If you want to understand the basic concept better, I highly recommend you give it a read.
